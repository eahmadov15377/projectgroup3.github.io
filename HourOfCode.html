      <h3>What Is H.O.C? </h3>
      <p>Hour of Code was a task which was conducted by ADA university professor Dr.Yusubov . Which consisted of students
        from SITE teaching the basics of the code.org to students from various high schools from different backgrounds.</p>

      <h3>The Event </h3>
      <p>In the Hour of code, students were shown a presentation with brief information about ADA University at first. Students
        were informed about achievements of the university at the global level and familiarized with future offers that the
        university is presenting. Consequently, team members continued the lesson plan on the main contents of the course.
        These concepts included human-machine interaction and language levels in computing, such as high/low level
        languages. Concepts were illustrated with visual and real-life examples, enabling active pupils’ engagement. In the
        next phase, participants were welcomed to deeper areas of coding, respectively the introduction to machine
        language and its levels. In the further chapter, practice on Code.org Minecraft was introduced to students. This
        applicatory stage involved students engaging in various coding tasks, with given objectives and rules. Pupils
        improved their problem-solving skills on these exercises and built the foundation of simple coding. Finally,
        students joined to solve questions in a premade quiz on Quiziz.com. The quiz covered theoretical, as well as
        problem-solving parts of the lesson.</p>

      <h3>Preparations of our group</h3>
      <p>The hardest thing about this event was finding which school would let us host it. A group of schools was listed,
        and these seven schools were asked to hold the event, but most of them responded negatively. The only middle school
        that allowed us to make the Hour of Code was the No. 193 Middle School. Our team arrived at the school two days
        prior to the event, ensuring that the required devices and tools are present in the class and to monitor the
        classroom where the event would be held. Once the school was identified, members started to discuss how to keep
        the pupils interested in the lesson by making it as participatory and educational as possible. The first stage of
        the lesson initiated with a plan in which, at the start of presenting ourselves and ADA University, then a short
        slideshow was cast by which the pupils can understand how code.org levels work. At the end of the lesson,
        participants were divided into teams and issued to a quiz consisting of 10 questions, which aimed to test memorial
        and applicatory knowledge.</p>
